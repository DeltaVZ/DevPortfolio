# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! Here, you can find a curated list of my personal projects and coding challenge that I worked on for fun or for some companies, showcasing my skills and expertise in various areas. Each project is housed in its own GitHub repository, which you can explore for more detailed information and source code.
Each coding challenge is anonymized and only pushed several months after the successful completion of them, so there's no way for a company to be exposed.

## About Me

I am **Software Engineer** with a **Master's Degree in Space and Astronautical Engineering** and with a **5 years experience in Software Engineering in the Space Sector**. I am passionate about Space and have extensive experience in Java and Python and some experience in Dart and Typescript. This portfolio includes projects that highlight my skills and accomplishments in Java, Python and Typescript.

## Open Source Projects

Below is a list of selected open source projects. Click on the project names to visit their respective repositories.

### 1. [Risk Estimation Challenge](https://github.com/DeltaVZ/RiskEstimationChallenge)
**Description**: The challenge provided some JNI functions and asked to create Java code so that risk estimations with problematic theta values in their risk trend are not suggested

**Technologies**: Java, Maven, MongoDB, TestNG, Mockito, Docker, Test Container, UML

**Highlights**:
- **Java and MongoDB API**: Use of Java coupled with MongoDB API
- **Unit and Integration testing**: Extensive code coverage thanks to TestNG, Mockito and Test Containers that create a containerized instance of MongoDB
- **UML**: UML diagrams produced via PUML

### 2. [power-profiles-enhancer](https://github.com/DeltaVZ/power-profiles-enhancer)
**Description**: Power Profiles Enhancer is a tool designed to enhance the capabilities of the power profiles daemon on Linux systems. By leveraging a custom Python script and configuration through INI files, this project adds additional functionality and optimizations, allowing users to better manage power consumption based on their specific needs.

**Technologies**: Python, Bash, venv, configparser, subprocess, Linux, systemd, power-profiles-daemon

**Highlights**:
- **Python**: Clean code written in Python with the use of libraries such as subprocess and configparser
- **Linux Service**: Runs as a Linux service for seamless integration and automatic application of enhancements.
- **Bash**: Includes a bash install script
- **Power Optimization**: Optimizes power consumption for different use cases, improving battery life or performance.
- **Custom Profiles**: Supports multiple customizable power profiles for various scenarios.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple to configure and use, suitable for all levels of Linux users.


### 3. [Web Crawler Challenge](https://github.com/DeltaVZ/web_crawler_challenge)
**Description**: The challenge asked to create a performant web crawler

**Technologies**: Python, pipenv, asyncio, aiohttp, beautifulsoup, mockito, html, UML

**Highlights**:
- **Python and Asyncio**: Use of Python coupled with the asyncio library to write concurrent code
- **Event Loop**: Demonstrates the use of asyncio's event loop to manage and schedule asynchronous tasks, ensuring smooth handling of concurrent operations
- **Asynchronous HTTP Requests**: Utilizes aiohttp to perform asynchronous HTTP requests, allowing the application to handle multiple requests concurrently without blocking, which is essential for high-performance applications
- **Efficient I/O Handling**: Shows how to efficiently manage I/O-bound operations, such as API calls and data fetching, by utilizing asynchronous features to avoid traditional threading or blocking calls.
- **HTML parsing**: Efficient HTML parsing using beautifulsoup4
- **Unit testing**: Extensive code coverage thanks to pytest and mockito
- **Highly configurable**: Extensive configuration is possible for different kinds of uses
- **UML**: UML diagrams produced via PUML

## Individual Closed Source Projects

### 1. [Neurodieta](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.drcuzzola.nutrizioneconsapevole.neurodieta&hl=en_US)
**Description**: A project that I worked on for a small client of which I'm the only developer that consists of:

- A RESTful web service written using Java Spring and deployed using tomcat on a CentOS machine
- An Admin GUI written in Typescript + Nuxt3: a GUI used by admins to accomplish control and configuration tasks, deployed on a machine only available on the local network of the client and accessible via Wireguard VPN
- An Android/iOS app written with Dart + Flutter that is to be used by customers and is available on both Play Store and Apple Store for modern Android and iOS devices

**How It Works**:
- The RESTful web service acts as the central hub, handling interactions and data management for both the Admin GUI and the mobile app. Additionally, it manages the sending of daily and weekly Telegram messages to an Admin channel.
- The Admin GUI allows administrators to manage user tasks and configurations securely.
- The mobile app delivers a user-friendly experience, with notifications enhancing user engagement and interaction.

A demo of the product is available only upon request.


**Technologies**: Dart, Flutter, Java, Spring, Tomcat, Nuxt3, Telegram API, Typescript, PostgreSQL, Android Studio, XCode, VSCode, Wireguard, Linux, Android, iOS, CentOS, SSL

**Highlights**:
- **Java+Spring**: Backend written in one of the most popular Java frameworks
- **PostgreSQL**: Extensive use of PostgreSQL for handling large amount of data for all customers
- **Tomcat**: Efficient deployment via tomcat
- **Dart+Flutter and Typescript+Nuxt3**: Use of Dart + Flutter and Typescript + Nuxt3 that demonstrates my adaptability to learn and work with new languages and frameworks in very little time
- **Android and iOS**: Proven knowledge of Android and iOS inner workings
- **Linux System Administration**: Proven experience in CentOS and Linux system administration
- **Telegram API**: Use of Telegram API to send daily and weekly reports to an admin channel
- **Integration testing**: Extensive flutter code coverage thanks to patrol 

### 2. [Neurodieta](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spacedev.eurobenzina&hl=en_US)
**Description**: A personal projects initially for exclusive personal use that I decided to publish so that friends can easily download it. It helps the user to easily see the average daily fuel prices per region in Italy (Gasoline, diesel and LPG) and also find the most convenient gas stations around. It uses freely available data from the Fuel Price Observatory of the Ministry of Business and Made in Italy.

The app is freely available to download on both the Google Play Store and the Apple Store and a big update will be released in 2024.


**Technologies**: Dart, Flutter, flutter_map, geolocator, google_mobile_ads

**Highlights**:
- **Dart+Flutter**: Use of Dart + Flutter, proving my experience in this framework
- **Flutter Map**: Proven experience in the use of Flutter Map and geolocation services
- **Google Mobile Ads**: Demonstrates my ability to integrate google mobile ads seamlessly in my mobile app

# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! Here, you can find a curated list of my personal projects and coding challenge that I worked on for fun or for some companies, showcasing my skills and expertise in various areas. Each project is housed in its own GitHub repository, which you can explore for more detailed information and source code.
Each coding challenge is anonymized and only pushed several months after the successful completion of them, so there's no way for a company to be exposed.

## About Me

I am Software Engineer with a Master's Degree in Space and Astronautical Engineering and with a 5 years experience in Software Engineering. I am passionate about Space and have extensive experience in Java and Python and some experience in Dart and Typescript. This portfolio includes projects that highlight my skills and accomplishments in Java, Python and Typescript.

## Projects

Below is a list of selected projects. Click on the project names to visit their respective repositories.

### 1. [Risk Estimation Challenge](https://github.com/DeltaVZ/RiskEstimationChallenge)
**Description**: The challenge provided some JNI functions and asked to create Java code so that risk estimations with problematic theta values in their risk trend are not suggested

**Technologies**: Java, Maven, MongoDB, TestNG, Mockito, Docker, Test Container, UML

**Highlights**:
- **Java and MongoDB API**: Use of Java coupled with MongoDB API
- **Integration testing**: Extensive code coverage thanks to TestNG, Mockito and Test Containers that create a containerized instance of MongoDB
- **UML**: UML diagrams produced via PUML

### 2. [power-profiles-enhancer](https://github.com/DeltaVZ/power-profiles-enhancer)
**Description**: Power Profiles Enhancer is a tool designed to enhance the capabilities of the power profiles daemon on Linux systems. By leveraging a custom Python script and configuration through INI files, this project adds additional functionality and optimizations, allowing users to better manage power consumption based on their specific needs.

**Technologies**: Python, Bash, venv, configparser, subprocess, systemd, power-profiles-daemon

**Highlights**:
- **Python**: Clean code written in Python with the use of libraries such as subprocess and configparser
- **Linux Service**: Runs as a Linux service for seamless integration and automatic application of enhancements.
- **Bash**: Includes a bash install script
- **Power Optimization**: Optimizes power consumption for different use cases, improving battery life or performance.
- **Custom Profiles**: Supports multiple customizable power profiles for various scenarios.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple to configure and use, suitable for all levels of Linux users.


### 3. [Web Crawler Challenge](https://github.com/DeltaVZ/web_crawler_challenge)
**Description**: The challenge asked to create a performant web crawler

**Technologies**: Python, pipenv, asyncio, aiohttp, beautifulsoup, mockito, html, UML

**Highlights**:
- **Python and Asyncio**: Use of Python coupled with the asyncio library to write concurrent code
- **Event Loop**: Demonstrates the use of asyncio's event loop to manage and schedule asynchronous tasks, ensuring smooth handling of concurrent operations
- **Asynchronous HTTP Requests**: Utilizes aiohttp to perform asynchronous HTTP requests, allowing the application to handle multiple requests concurrently without blocking, which is essential for high-performance applications
- **Efficient I/O Handling**: Shows how to efficiently manage I/O-bound operations, such as API calls and data fetching, by utilizing asynchronous features to avoid traditional threading or blocking calls.
- **HTML parsing**: Efficient HTML parsing using beautifulsoup4
- **Unit testing**: Extensive code coverage thanks to pytest and mockito
- **Highly configurable**: Extensive configuration is possible for different kinds of uses
- **UML**: UML diagrams produced via PUML

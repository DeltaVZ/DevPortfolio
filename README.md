# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! Here, you can find a curated list of my personal projects and coding challenge that I worked on for fun or for some companies, showcasing my skills and expertise in various areas. Each project is housed in its own GitHub repository, which you can explore for more detailed information and source code.
Each coding challenge is anonymize and only pushed much after the successful completion of them, so there's no way for a company to be exposed.

## Projects

Below is a list of selected projects. Click on the project names to visit their respective repositories.

### 1. [Risk Estimation Challenge](https://github.com/DeltaVZ/RiskEstimationChallenge)
**Description**: The challenge provided some JNI functions and asked to create Java code so that risk estimations with problematic theta values in their risk trend are not suggested

**Technologies**: Java, Maven, MongoDB, TestNG, Mockito, Docker, Test Container, UML

**Highlights**:
- **Java and MongoDB API**: Use of Java coupled with MongoDB API
- **Integration testing**: Extensive code coverage thanks to TestNG, Mockito and Test Containers that create a containerized instance of MongoDB
- **UML**: UML diagrams produced via PUML

### 2. [power-profiles-enhancer](https://github.com/DeltaVZ/power-profiles-enhancer)
**Description**: Power Profiles Enhancer is a tool designed to enhance the capabilities of the power profiles daemon on Linux systems. By leveraging a custom Python script and configuration through INI files, this project adds additional functionality and optimizations, allowing users to better manage power consumption based on their specific needs.

**Technologies**: Python, Bash, venv, configparser, subprocess, systemd, power-profiles-daemon

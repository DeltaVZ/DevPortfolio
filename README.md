# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! Here, you can find a curated list of my personal projects and coding challenge that I worked on for fun or for some companies, showcasing my skills and expertise in various areas. Each project is housed in its own GitHub repository, which you can explore for more detailed information and source code.
Each coding challenge is anonymized and only pushed several months after the successful completion of them, so there's no way for a company to be exposed.

## Individual Closed Source Projects

### 1. [Neurodieta](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.drcuzzola.nutrizioneconsapevole.neurodieta&hl=en_US)
**Description**: A project that I worked on for a small client of which I'm the only developer that consists of:

- A RESTful web service written using Java Spring and deployed using tomcat on a CentOS machine
- An Admin GUI written in Typescript + Nuxt3: a GUI used by admins to accomplish control and configuration tasks, deployed on a machine only available on the local network of the client and accessible via Wireguard VPN
- An Android/iOS app written with Dart + Flutter that is to be used by customers and is available on both Play Store and Apple Store for modern Android and iOS devices

**How It Works**:
- The RESTful web service acts as the central hub, handling interactions and data management for both the Admin GUI and the mobile app. Additionally, it manages the sending of daily and weekly Telegram messages to an Admin channel.
- The Admin GUI allows administrators to manage user tasks and configurations securely.
- The mobile app delivers a user-friendly experience, with notifications enhancing user engagement and interaction.

A demo of the product is available only upon request.
